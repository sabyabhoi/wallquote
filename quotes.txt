Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.
You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
Talk to someone about themselves and they'll listen for hours.
To be interesting, be interested.
Names are the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
